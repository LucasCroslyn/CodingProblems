This is a begineer/basic skill path in CodeCademy for learning data science. While other projects may be more complex, these are mainly for reviewing my skills and seeing if I can pick up anything along the way. Covers Python (and Python data libraries) and SQL.

### Official Description
Data Science is one of the most in-demand skillsets that companies are constantly hiring for. This Skill Path will teach you the basics of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data. You will learn industry-standard languages and libraries including Python, pandas, and SQL. Along the way, you will create real-world projects to practice and demonstrate your analytics skills.

### Projects Order + Description
1. [SQL Independent Projects](Data%20Science%20SQL%20Independent%20Projects)

    These projects are for learning basic SQL queries on some data. No data was created or added to the tables, only table creation was converting csv files to the correct format. 

2. [Medical Insurance Mini Projects](Medical%20Insurance%20Projects)

    These basic projects a separated based on Python topics (loops, functions, strings, etc.) and framed around the same data theme (medical insurance). Each are very rudamentary in what they involve and are here for completionist sake.  

3. [Basic Cryptography Project](Coded_Correspondence.ipynb)

    A project exploring Python strings in a slightly more complex nature. The project involves creating functions for encoding and decoding the Caesar and Vigen√®re Ciphers.

4. [Hurricane Analysis Project](Hurricane_Analysis.ipynb)

    A project that mainly uses dictionaries to interact and analyze given hurricane data. The data is hardcoded within the project file so no interacting with dataset files or APIs.  

5. [Linear Regression](Reggie_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
   
   A project that explores linear regression in a very basic manner. It does not actually involve using data and linear regression in the traditional sense (using math to solve for m/b/x/y) but moreso using it to explore loops and lists. Pretty basic of a project but here for completionist sake.

6. [Medical Insurance Full Project](Medical%20Insurance%20Full%20Project)

    An expansion on the Medical Insurance Mini Projects, this one is less guided and more open-ended for what to do. Combines various aspects of Python instead of being focused on a certain one like the mini projects. This project has a full dataset to work with and analyze as well, which the mini ones do not.
