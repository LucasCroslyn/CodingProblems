This is a begineer/basic skill path in CodeCademy for learning data science. While other projects may be more complex, these are mainly for reviewing my skills and seeing if I can pick up anything along the way. Covers Python (and Python data libraries) and SQL.

### Official Description
Data Science is one of the most in-demand skillsets that companies are constantly hiring for. This Skill Path will teach you the basics of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data. You will learn industry-standard languages and libraries including Python, pandas, and SQL. Along the way, you will create real-world projects to practice and demonstrate your analytics skills.

### Projects Order + Description
1. [SQL Independent Projects](Data%20Science%20SQL%20Independent%20Projects)

    These projects are for learning basic SQL queries on some data. No data was created or added to the tables, only table creation was converting csv files to the correct format. 

2. [Medical Insurance Projects](Medical%20Insurance%20Projects)

    These basic projects a separated based on Python topics (loops, functions, strings, etc.) and framed around the same data theme (medical insurance). Each are very rudamentary in what they involve and are here for completionist sake.  

3. [Basic Cryptography Project](coded_correspondence.ipynb)

    A project exploring Python strings in a slightly more complex nature. The project involves creating functions for encoding and decoding the Caesar and Vigen√®re Ciphers.
