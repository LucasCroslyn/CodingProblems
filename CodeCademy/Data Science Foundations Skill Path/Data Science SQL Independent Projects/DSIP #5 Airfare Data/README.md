# Introduction
This project is hosted on the CodeCademy forums as an independant project to gain further understanding of working with fairly basic SQL.

# Database
The database is the example database downloaded through the project link above.

The database has information about airfare data, specifically ' data covering the top 1,000 contiguous state city-pair markets'

We are not provided a entity relationship diagram as there is only 1 table. We are also not provided a description of columns but an investigation will be done to see what they are.

# Questions
## Basic Questions
1. What range of years are represented in the data?
2. What are the shortest and longest-distanced flights, and between which 2 cities are they?
3. How many distinct cities are represented in the data (regardless of whether it is the source or destination)?
4. Which airline appear most frequently as the carrier with the lowest fare (ie. carrier_low)? How about the airline with the largest market share (ie. carrier_lg)?
5. How many instances are there where the carrier with the largest market share is not the carrier with the lowest fare? What is the average difference in fare?

## Intermediate Questions
6. What is the percent change in average fare from 2007 to 2017 by flight? How about from 1997 to 2017?
7. How would you describe the overall trend in airfares from 1997 to 2017, as compared 2007 to 2017?

## Advanced Questions
8. What is the average fare for each quarter? Which quarter of the year has the highest overall average fare? lowest?
9. Considering only the flights that have data available on all 4 quarters of the year, which quarter has the highest overall average fare? lowest? Try breaking it down by year as well.
