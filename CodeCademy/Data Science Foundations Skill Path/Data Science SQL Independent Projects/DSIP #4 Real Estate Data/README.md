# Introduction
This project is hosted on the CodeAcademy forums as an independant project to gain further understanding of working with fairly basic SQL.

# Database
The database is the example database downloaded through the project link above. It is not provided in this repo directly as the file is too big.

The database has information about real estate investments, specifically 'data on median estimated values of single family homes by zip codes from the past two decades'

We are not provided a entity relationship diagram as there is only 1 table (aside from the last question). We are also not provided a description of columns but an investigation will be done to see what they are.

# Questions
## Basic Questions
1. How many distinct zip codes are in this dataset?
2. How many zip codes are from each state?
3. What range of years are represented in the data?
4. Using the most recent month of data available, what is the range of estimated home values across the nation?
5. Using the most recent month of data available, which states have the highest average home values? How about the lowest?
6. Which states have the highest/lowest average home values for the year of 2017? What about for the year of 2007? 1997?

## Intermediate Questions
7. What is the percent change in average home values from 2007 to 2017 by state? How about from 1997 to 2017?
8. How would you describe the trend in home values for each state from 1997 to 2017? How about from 2007 to 2017? Which states would you recommend for making real estate investments?

## Advanced Questions
9. Join the house value data with the table of zip-code level census data. Do there seem to be any correlations between the estimated house values and characteristics of the area, such as population count or median household income?

(The census data is from the previous project, DSIP #3, the data has been copied into this directory as well)
