This is the first project for the Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part I) module within this skill path, specifically the Python Syntax and Variables Types lesson.

While this project (and module) is extremely basic to other things I've done, it is here for completionist sake.

This project does have the [solutions](Medical_Insurance_Project_Solution.ipynb) to make sure my [work](Medical_Insurance_Project.ipynb) is done correctly
